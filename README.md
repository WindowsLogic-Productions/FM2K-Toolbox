# FM2K-Toolbox
A toolbox for modding FM95/FM2K and FM95/FM2K games. If you have any knowledge on Visual Basic.NET or C#, then you're welcome to help with development!

If you have knowledge on C++ and can create plug-ins for the future plug-in manager, please lend a hand too! You can create and upload your solutions in this repo to keep everything consolidated.

# Issue Reporting & Other
The only way to inject plug-ins at the moment is through FM2K's unused WSOCK32.dll. This is obviously limiting, but hopefully this interface will make it a lot easier.

If you find something broken or not working correctly, open an issue in the Issues tab and we'll get straight to fixing it!
